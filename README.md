A machine learning app that predicts the probability of having a heart Disease made with streamlit.

The model was saved as pkl file.

We used the streamlit framework to make the app and scikit-learn to build the model.

The deployed web app is live at https://heart-disease-hbi.herokuapp.com/


The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
